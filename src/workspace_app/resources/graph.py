    """One extracted metric measurement — flat, queryable evidence (#534 slice 1).

    Collection-scoped (permission inherits like SourceDoc / DocChunk via the
    cascade ``Ref``); ``source_doc_id`` / ``chunk_id`` are the provenance back to
    the source deck/slide. ``value`` is stored VERBATIM ("1.2M", "15%") —
    normalisation (parse → number + unit) is a later, app-side concern.

    Indexed: ``collection_id`` (Ref, auto), ``norm_metric`` + ``period`` (filter a
    metric's values across decks and, later, rollup grouping), ``source_doc_id``
    (so a re-extraction can wipe + rewrite one doc's claims). ``norm_metric`` is
    the server-computed normalised key; ``metric`` keeps the raw surface form for
    display.

    #534 slice 2: the ``collection_*`` / ``doc_*`` fields are a denormalized
    mirror of the READ permission of the deck this claim came from, so
    ``graph_claim_access_scope`` can hide the row at the storage layer, which is
    where the auto-CRUD read routes are covered without a hand-written guard on
    each. (``GET /{model}/export`` is the exception — it bypasses access scopes for
    every model in the app, ``source-doc`` and ``collection`` included, so it is a
    pre-existing hole this does not close.)
    They are written by the extractor and re-pushed by the permission fan-out;
    nothing else may set them. The mirror is the doc's EFFECTIVE permission, both
    layers: its collection's (#303) and its own tightening (#308).

"""#262 — per-verb WRITE authorization on a Collection (the 403 layer that rides
on top of ``access_scope``'s 404 visibility layer).

``access_scope`` (perm.scope) already turns a row the caller can't ``read_meta``
into a uniform 404, so this checker only runs for rows the caller can already see.
Its job is the finer "may I do THIS action?" decision:

* ``update`` / ``modify`` / ``patch`` → ``write_meta``. A write that also changes
  the embedded ``permission`` additionally requires ``change_permission`` — so the
  generic ``PUT`` / ``PATCH /collection/{id}`` can't be used to rewire access
  control (the dedicated ``PUT …/permission`` endpoint is the only metadata path
  that carries ``change_permission``).
* ``delete`` / ``permanently_delete`` / ``switch`` / ``restore`` → owner or
  superuser only (a read/write member can't destroy the collection — the FE's
  delete button hits ``DELETE /collection/{id}/permanently``).

Reads (``get`` / ``search``) and ``create`` return ``allow`` (no opinion) — reads
are governed by ``access_scope``, and create has no existing row to authorize
against. This is why we DON'T use ``ActionBasedPermissionChecker``: it returns
``not_applicable`` for unmapped actions, and specstar's ``PermissionEventHandler``
treats anything other than ``allow`` as a denial — which would 403 every read and
create on the collection.

WIRING (specstar 0.11.11 caveat): ``add_model(permission_checker=…)`` does NOT
work — ``ResourceManager`` is built with ``self.permission_checker or
permission_checker`` and the spec-level default is a truthy ``AllowAll()``, so the
per-model checker is always shadowed (only ``access_scope`` is threaded straight
through). We therefore attach the checker via the per-model ``event_handlers`` slot
(``self.event_handlers`` defaults to ``None`` ⇒ falsy ⇒ the per-model list wins),
wrapping it in specstar's ``PermissionEventHandler`` so its
``required_resource_parts`` are aggregated and ``current_resource`` (META + DATA)
is loaded for the write check. See ``collection_permission_event_handler``.

Unlike the intended (shadowed) ``permission_checker`` — which specstar would fire
ONLY on request-originated auto-CRUD routes — an event handler fires on EVERY
``ResourceManager`` write, including programmatic ones. The only programmatic
non-create Collection write is the code-repo sync's git-metadata stamp, which acts
as the collection owner (see ``kb.code_repo``) so it passes ``write_meta``.

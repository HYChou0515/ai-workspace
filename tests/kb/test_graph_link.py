"""#534 B — building the vocabulary from evidence, deterministically.

This is the first and safest of the four bases: mentions whose comparison key is
identical are one thing. It needs no model and no reviewer, and it is the bulk of
the work — most of what makes two surfaces differ is typing noise the key already
removed.

The job is a RECONCILE, not a one-shot build: it re-runs, and running it twice
must change nothing the second time. Entities and their links accumulate; nothing
is rebuilt from scratch, because the links are what a human's decisions are
recorded as and a rebuild would throw them away.
